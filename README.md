Created a to do list application creating a full stack application from the Dom to the database.

- created front end experience to: create task, complete task & delete task
- all tasks, completed status and deleted tasks are stored on the database as well as displayed on the DOM
- there is a visual difference between a completed task and an uncompleted task
- all tasks are stored on the database, whether it is completed or not
- the items move to the bottom of the list when completed
- confirm box pops up when one of the items is deleted
